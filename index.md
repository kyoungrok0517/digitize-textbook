## Digitizing Textbooks

I'm a graduate student at [KAIST](http://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/index.html). I'm currently studying Natural Language Processing.

As you might know we read a lot of texts, including journal papers and textbooks. The textbooks are chest of valuable knowledge, but their problem is they are way THICK AND HEAVY! Thankfully I own ipad and carry bunch of PDFs, but now the concern is how to make them searchable. Accurate text recognition is crucial for effective information search and aggregation.

### Why I need ABBYY FineReader?

- Outstanding OCR performance. Only ABBYY FineReader's OCR speed and precision meets my needs. I came to this conclusion after testing the following softwares:
  - ABBYY FineReader (of course)
  - Acrobat Pro DC
  - ScanSnap IX500's embeded OCR
- ABBYY FineReader's advanced features such as table & equation detection is necessary for digitizing the books full of such artifacts

### Quota Request

- I have many textbooks consist of 800-1000 pages. Also I read 9-10 books related to my field. So **5,000 pages/month** would be sufficient.
